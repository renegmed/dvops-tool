HTTP Requests in Go

The Go standard library includes the HTTP 
package which is used for sending and 
receiving 

You can create a client instance or make 
simple requests with a default client 


Headers 

HTTPHeaders

Headers are used to provide metadata 
about HTTP requests 

We will be using headers primarily for 
authentication credentials


Processing Content 

REST API Content

REST API requests and responses typically
have JSON formatted content 

Go includes JSON support for marshaling and 
unmarshaling this content


Error Handling

REST APIs have typical error responses 
as any HTTP request might have 

Often with REST APIs there will be 
additional error information included 
in the body of the response
