Section 6 topics

    Designing the API

    Implementation with Nap

    Writing tests



GitHub Library API

Nap is our library for interacting with REST APIs

We are going to use it in this section to
interact with GitHub by creating a GitHub 
API layer 



$ glide get gopkg.in/src-d/go-git.v4

$ glide get github.com/spf13/viper

$ glide update

To clone
$ pork clone mspaulding06/nap --ref master --create


Implementaion with Nap

Here we are going to provide all the 
implementation for the various 
features of the Pork tool using the Nap
REST library that we have created
