Encryption and Authentication

Encryption is used to protect sensitive
information so that it can only be
understood by the intended party

Authentication is used only to verify the 
source of information 


Basic Authentication

Basic authentication uses an HTTP header
to supply credentials for RES API calls 

Credentials are not encrypted

curl -I -v https://httpbin.org/basic 


Token Authentication

Token authentication uses specially
generated tokens that give limited and 
temporary access to API calls based on a 
user's authentication credentials

Why Tokens?

Credentials are temporary 
Tokens can be revoked
Tokens can be rotated 
Access can be limited
